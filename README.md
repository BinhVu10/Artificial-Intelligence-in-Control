## üôè Acknowledgment  

This repository was developed as part of the *Artificial Intelligence in Control* course at HCMUT (2025).  
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to **PhD. Pham Viet Cuong** and my teammates for their guidance and support throughout the course.  

Special thanks to the following resources that greatly contributed to my understanding and implementation of the algorithms:  
- [Machine Learning C∆° B·∫£n](https://machinelearningcoban.com/) ‚Äî an excellent Vietnamese resource that helped strengthen my foundational knowledge of machine learning.  
- [ML-From-Scratch by Erik Linder-Nor√©n](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/ML-From-Scratch) ‚Äî an open-source GitHub repository that provided valuable insights into implementing machine learning algorithms from the ground up.
