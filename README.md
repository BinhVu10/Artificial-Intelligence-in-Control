# ðŸ¤– Artificial Intelligence in Control

Welcome to my repository for the **AI in Control** course!  
This repo contains all my coding assignments and experiments related to implementation of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and more.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project explores the integration of **Artificial Intelligence** techniques into control theory through a set of hands-on exercises.  
Each notebook focuses on a key concept in machine learning and its application to control systems.
